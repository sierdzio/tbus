Configure script prepares tbus for daily usage by installing it to home
or root binary paths.

Options:
  -l or --local - installs tbus for current user (executables are put in
    $HOME/bin, various other tbus files in $HOME/.tbus). This also adds
    $HOME/bin to $PATH in bash .profile (if not present already)
  -g or --global - installs tbus for all users, putting binaries to /usr/bin
