Configure script prepares tbus for daily usage by installing it to home
or root search paths. Configure can be run multiple times (for example, when
you update tbus version to a newer one), it will overwrite any existing files.

Options:
  -l or --local - installs tbus for current user (executables are put in
    $HOME/bin, various other tbus files in $HOME/.tbus). This also adds
    $HOME/bin to $PATH in bash .profile (if not present already)
  -g or --global - installs tbus for all users, putting binaries to /usr/bin.
    You need admin privileges to do it (if not present, tbus will ask for them)
  --uninstall - (not implemented yet) removes your current tbus installation.
    Warning: this will tbus completely, including your global and local
    configuration, binaries and (TBD) all downloaded data. Some more delicate
    adjustments are planned here (ability to choose what should be deleted,
    for a start!)

For now, local installation is recommended - global one has not been tested!

WARNING: you don't need to run make or make install after running configure. As
  currently tbus does not contain any compilable source code, there is no need
  for it to use 'make'.
