Configure script prepares tbus for daily usage by installing it to home
or root binary paths. Configure can be run multiple times (for example, after
you update tbus version to a newer one), it will overwrite any existing files.

Options:
  -l or --local - installs tbus for current user (executables are put in
    $HOME/bin, various other tbus files in $HOME/.tbus). This also adds
    $HOME/bin to $PATH in bash .profile (if not present already)
  -g or --global - installs tbus for all users, putting binaries to /usr/bin

For now, the default is to install tbus locally. When tbus is ready for
production, it will switch to global as the default.

WARNING: you don't need to run make or make install after running configure. As
  currently tbus does not contain any compilable source code, there is no need
  for it to use 'make'.
