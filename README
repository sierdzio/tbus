tbus is an automated system that aims to make software distribution easy and cheap.
For small vendors, it has the benefit of not requiring any working server, or broad
upload bandwidth. For big vendors, it allows to lower server load. For everybody it
means higher transfers, and greater availability of software, even if "main server"
is not operational.

tbus combines gpg, git and torrent protocol to make sure that all data is properly
signed, downloaded without errors.
