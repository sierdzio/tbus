tbus - torrent-based update system
Copyright (c) 2013 by Tomasz Siekierda, sierdzio@gmail.com

This product is free software, see the LICENSE file for more details.

tbus is an automated and distributed update system that aims to make software
distribution easy and cheap. For small vendors, it has the benefit of
not requiring any working server, or high upload bandwidth.
For big vendors, it allows to lower server load. For everybody it means higher
transfers, and greater availability of software, even if "main server"
is not operational.

tbus combines gpg, git and torrent protocol to make sure that all data is properly
signed, downloaded without errors.

WARNING: this project is in very early stages of development. Barely anything works
at the moment. Feel free to look around (and submit patches! :-)), but don't expect
too much just yet.
