tbus - torrent-based update system
Copyright (c) 2013 by Tomasz Siekierda, sierdzio@gmail.com

This product is free software, see the LICENSE file for more details.

tbus is an automated and distributed update system that aims to make software
distribution easy and cheap. For small vendors, it has the benefit of
not requiring any working server, or high upload bandwidth.
For big vendors, it allows to lower server load. For everybody it means higher
transfers, and greater availability of software, even if "main server"
is not operational.

tbus combines gpg, git and torrent protocol to make sure that all data is properly
signed and downloaded without errors.

If unsure how to use it, wait for the documentation to be developed ;) Or you
can gather knowledge using --help flag. All tbus commands have some helpful (hopefully)
output for this flag. So, start with:
tbus --help

To create a new repository, run tbus-init:
tbus init --help

To clone an existing one, use tbus-clone or tbus-connect (they are synonyms):
tbus clone --help

Then you can start adding changes. tbus follows git API pretty closely, so if you
know git, you should be able to learn pretty fast. tbus works by storing torrent
files for all data you add. You are responsible for keeping the data somewhere,
tbus manages torrent files only.

tbus can be run in archive mode: it will not overwrite downloaded data, but put
it in separate directories based on date/ version of the file. This allows for easy
creation of content mirrors that are able to serve different peers who want to
download data that is not necessarily bleeding-edge. Also, quite interestingly,
this feature is not implemented at all yet :P

WARNING: this project is in very early stages of development. Barely anything works
at the moment. Feel free to look around (and submit patches! :-)), but don't expect
too much just yet.
