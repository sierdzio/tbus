# TODO in tbus. Those are only general items. Specific details are listed in
# relevant parts of the code:
 - add bash auto completion
 - consider adding a unified command line parser
 - move to C++ ;)
 - add tests and automated regression test suite for the whole project
 - port and test on Windows :-(
 - add .deb and .rpm packages
 - add configure script
 - add debug functionality (some easy to implement flag shared between all commands)
 - decide between transmission-cli and transmission-daemon (for multiple instance
   stuff)
