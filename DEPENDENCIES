tbus dependencies are likely to change over time. The project has started as
a collection of bash scripts but it's probable that it will migrate some of them
to C++.

So, current list is as follows:
 - bash, ls, cat, dirname
 - git
 - transmission-cli (temporary), libktorrent (planned)
 - gpg2 (planned)
